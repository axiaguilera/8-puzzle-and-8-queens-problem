# Solving 8-Puzzle and 8-Queens Problems using Heuristic Search Techniques

This project involves generating a large number of instances for two classical AI problems - the 8-puzzle and the 8-queens problem - and solving them using various heuristic search techniques. These techniques include hill climbing (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing. The project aims to evaluate and compare these techniques based on search cost and success rate.

**Objectives:**

- Generate a large number of instances for both the 8-puzzle and the 8-queens problem.

- Implement and apply hill climbing (both steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing to solve these problems.

- Measure the search cost and the percentage of solved problems for each technique.

- Compare these metrics against the optimal solution cost and visualize the results.

**Methodology:**

- Start by generating a diverse set of instances for the 8-puzzle and the 8-queens problem. The instances should represent a range of difficulty levels to challenge the heuristic search techniques.

- Implement the chosen heuristic search techniques - hill climbing (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing.

- Solve the generated instances using each of the implemented techniques, recording the search cost and whether the problem was successfully solved.

- Calculate the optimal solution cost for each problem instance and compare it with the results obtained from the heuristic techniques. This comparison will provide a measure of the effectiveness of each technique.

- Graph the results to provide a visual representation of how each technique performs relative to the optimal solution.

**Expected Outcomes:**

The expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive comparative study of various heuristic search techniques applied to the 8-puzzle and the 8-queens problem. The study will provide insights into the effectiveness of each technique based on search cost and success rate, and the visualized results will offer a clear perspective on the performance of each technique relative to the optimal solution cost. This project aims to contribute to the understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different heuristic search techniques when applied to complex problem-solving tasks.
